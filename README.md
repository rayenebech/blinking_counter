# Embedded Systems - Blink Counter System

## Description
```
An average person blinks 10-12 times per minute. Therefore, with the system we have designed, we can get meaningful results by using the "minute" as a unit, by which we can measure the amount of interest of the audience.

The system includes 3 LEDs and 1 OLED display for output display. Blue LED represents below-average blink, green LED represents average blink, and red LED represents above-average blink in 1 minute.

The instantaneous blink amount is shown on the OLED screen and the instantaneous seconds are shown below.
